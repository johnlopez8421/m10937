# m10937
M10937 VFD display driver for AVR 328P

This is a C interface library for the M10937 VFD (vacuum fluorescent display) integrated circuit. This was written for and tested on an Arduino compatible board hosting an Atmel 328P microcontroller. This should be easily portable to other platforms, as long as a relatively precise and high resolution delay function is available for the platform.
